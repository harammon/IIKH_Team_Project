1. Change directory to excutable file. It is in "IIKH/Release/" and file name is "Team1-IIKH.exe"

2. Just execute "Team1-IIKH.exe". You don't need any command.
 * the Input files are already in excutable file directory.
 * you can also delete all input file and execute. Then, if you view all recipe or plan, it is empty.

[Important]
 * Instead of file1.txt we used our own DB files.
 * DB files are named(IIKHPlanDB.csv, IIKHRecipeDB.csv) and you can open it by Excel.
 * You can Test our Program with sample DB files. It is in "IIKH/Sample_Input/" directory.
 * If no DB files are detected, our program creates empty DB files(IIKHPlanDB.csv, IIKHRecipeDB.csv) in directory where our program is located.
